# üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline for Containerised AI Model Deployment on AWS ECS

This project demonstrates how to automate the deployment of a containerized AI model using GitHub Actions, Docker, and AWS ECS (Fargate). The focus is on implementing a complete DevOps pipeline for model versioning, testing, secure deployment, and rollback support ‚Äî without relying on manual infrastructure management.

---

## üìå Project Overview

- **Goal:** Deploy and manage a lightweight AI model using a CI/CD pipeline.
- **Infrastructure:** AWS ECS (Fargate), ECR, CloudWatch, IAM, GitHub Actions
- **DevOps Tools:** Terraform, Docker, GitHub Actions
- **Focus Areas:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC), CI/CD, container orchestration, secrets management, rollback and update strategies.

---

## üß† Use Case

This project is designed for cloud engineers, DevOps engineers, and AI infrastructure developers who want to:

- Automate ML model deployment using CI/CD
- Use AWS ECS and ECR in a scalable and serverless fashion
- Improve reliability with IaC, monitoring, and autoscaling

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. Local Development
- You develop and test your FastAPI app + model locally in Docker.
- Ensure all Python dependencies are in `requirements.txt`.

### 2. Version Control
- You push changes to GitHub.
- This triggers the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Lints and tests your code (optional).
- Builds and tags the Docker image with the Git commit SHA.
- Pushes image to Amazon ECR.
- Updates ECS service with the new task definition automatically.

### 4. AWS ECS Fargate
- Pulls the latest Docker image from ECR.
- Deploys it in a secure, auto-scalable Fargate task.
- Logs and metrics are pushed to CloudWatch.
